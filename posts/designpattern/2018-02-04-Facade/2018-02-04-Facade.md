## Characteristics of Facade
- To abstract out existing implementaion of a Class (e.g. API)
- Internally facade uses composition
- Facade doesn't require any interface
- Useful while refactoring existing class

## Examples of Facade
- FacesContext (javax.faces.context)
- ExternalContext (javax.faces.context)

## Java Implementaion

**Phone.class**{: .heading1}  

```java
public interface Phone {

    String build();
}
```

<br/>

**IPhone.class**{: .heading1}  

```java
public class IPhone implements Phone {

    @Override
    public java.lang.String build() {
        return "IOS 10";
    }
}
```

<br/>

**FacadeExample.class**{: .heading1}  

```java
public class FacadeExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Cleaner Client Code
        PhoneFacade phoneFacade = new PhoneFacade();

        // We are creating phone using facade without going through complex logic
        System.out.println(phoneFacade.buildAndroidPhone());
        System.out.println(phoneFacade.buildApplePhone());
    }
}
```

## Disadvantages of Facade
- Overuse of the facade pattern under which a lot of legacy code is present
